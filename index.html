<p>TK Define <strong><em>least child page</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>: Alan! Your audience is you, or someone who knows enough Node.js,
CoffeeScript and algorithms to hack on this. This is not a lesson on
b&#x2011;trees. (Note to self as I write Docco.)</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Strata stores JSON objects on disk, according to a sort order of your
choosing, indexed for fast retrieval.</p>

<p>Strata is faster than a flat file, lighter than a database, with more capacity
than an in&#x2011;memory tree.</p>

<p>Strata is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">b&#x2011;tree</a>
implementation for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> that is <strong>evented</strong>,
<strong>concurrent</strong>, <strong>persistent</strong> and <strong>durable</strong>.</p>

<p>Strata is <strong>evented</strong>. It uses asynchronous I/O to read and write
b&#x2011;tree pages, allowing your CPU to continue to do work while Strata
waits on I/O.</p>

<p>Strata is <strong>concurrent</strong>. Strata will answer any queries from its
in&#x2011;memory cache when it can, so requests can be satisifed even when
there are evented I/O requests outstanding.</p>

<p>Strata is <strong>persistent</strong>. It stores your tree in page files. The page files
are plain old JSON, text files that are easy to manage. You can view them with
<code>less</code> or <code>tail -f</code>, back them up hot using <code>rsync</code>, and version them with
<code>git</code>.</p>

<p>Strata is <strong>durable</strong>. It only appends records to to file, so a hard shutdown
will only ever lose the few last records added. Pages are journaled when they
are vacuumed or rewritten. </p>

<p>Strata is a b&#x2011;tree. A b&#x2011;tree is a database primiative. Using
Strata, you can start to experiment with database designs of your own. You can
use Strata to build an MVCC database table, like PostgreSQL. You can create
Strata b&#x2011;trees to create indexes into structured data that is not
already in a database, like monster log files. You can use Strata to store
your data in what ever form of JSON suits you like a NoSQL database.</p>

<p>As a bonus, Strata is two database primatives in one, because with a time
series index, you can use Strata as a write&#x2011;ahead log.</p>

<p>Strata runs anywhere that Node.js runs, in pure JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>

<p>Documentation for Strata is presented here, in literate programming style. API
documentation is not yet available, so scoot down to the <code>Strata</code> class for an
in-depth look at the API. Have a look at the extensive test suite for examples
on the different operations.</p>

<p>If you find a bug with Strata, please report it at the <a href="https://github.com/bigeasy/strata/issues">GitHub
Issues</a>. If you want to leave a
comment on the documentation or the code, you can ping me, Alan Gutierrez, at
@<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bigeasy">bigeasy</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>Feel free to fork and explore. Note that Strata is a database primitive, not a
database in itself. Before you fork and add what you feel are missing
features, please consult with me. Perhaps your ideas are better expressed as
project that employs Strata, intead of to a patch to Strata itself.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>We refer to the nodes in our b&#x2011;tree as <strong><em>pages</em></strong>. The term node
conjures an image of a discrete component in a linked data structure that
contains one, maybe two or three, values. Nodes in a b&#x2011;tree contain
hundreds or thousands of values. They are indexed. They are read from disk.
They are allowed to fall out of memory when they have not been recently
referenced. These are behaviors that people associate with a page of values.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we use common terminology for <strong><em>height</em></strong>, <strong><em>depth</em></strong>,
<strong><em>parent</em></strong>, <strong><em>child</em></strong>, <strong><em>split</em></strong> and <strong><em>merge</em></strong>.</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast definition for all the terms. A leaf is a fuzzy
concept in b&#x2011;tree literature, for example. We call a page that contains
records a <strong><em>leaf page</em></strong>. We call a non-leaf page a <strong><em>branch page</em></strong>. The
term <strong><em>order</em></strong> means different things to different people.  We define the
order of a branch page to be the maximum number of child pages, while the
order of a leaf page to be the maximum number of records.</p>

<p>The term <strong><em>b&#x2011;tree</em></strong> itself may not be correct. There are different
names for b&#x2011;tree that reflect the variations of implementation, but
those distinctions have blurred over the years. Our implemenation may be
considered a b+tree, since pages are linked, and records are stored only in
the leaves.</p>

<p>Terms specific to our implementation will be introduced as they are
encountered in the document. </p>

<h2>What is a b&#x2011;tree?</h2>

<p>This documentation assumes that you understand the theory behind the
b&#x2011;tree, and know the variations of implementation. If you are
interested in learning about b&#x2011;trees you should start with the
Wikipedia articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-trees</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+trees</a>. I was introduced to
b&#x2011;trees while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201314525">Algorithms in
C</a>, quite some time ago.</p>

<h2>What flavor of b&#x2011;tree is this?</h2>

<p>Strata is a b&#x2011;tree with leaf pages that contain records ordered by the
collation order of the tree. Records are stored for retrieval in constant
time, addressed by an integer index, so that they can be found using binary
search.</p>

<p>Branch pages contain links to other pages, and do not store records
themselves.</p>

<p>Leaf pages are linked in ascending order to simply the implementatoin of
traversal by cursors. Branch pages are singly linked in ascending order to
simplify implementation of branch page merges.</p>

<p>The order of a branch page is the maximum number of children for a branch
page. The order of a leaf page is maximum number of records for a leaf page.
When a page exceeds its order it is split into two or more pages. When two
sibling pages next to each other can be combined to create a page less than
than the order they are merged.</p>

<p>The b&#x2011;tree always has a root branch page. The height of the tree
increases when the root branch page is split. It decreases when the root
branch page is merged. The split of the root branch is a different operation
from the split of a non-root branch, because the root branch does not have
siblings.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><h2>Collation</h2>

<p>A b&#x2011;tree has a collation defined by the application developer.</p>

<p>The collation is determined by the combination of an extractor and a
comparator. The extractor is used to extract a key from the stored record. The
comparator is used to order records by comparing the key.</p>

<p>Separating extraction from comparison allows us to cache the key. We do not
need the whole record for comparison, only the key. Keys are used to order the
tree, so when we will constantly be reading records off the disk solely to get
their key value.</p>

<p>If a record is read for its key, but the record is not soon visited by a
cursor, it will eventually be collected by a cache purge, If the key is
frequently consulted by queries as they descend the tree, the key will be
retained. If the key is subset of a large record, purging the records and
retaining the keys will reduce the in&#x2011;memory size of the b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<p>Also, the comparator is pretty easily generalized, while the exractor is
invariably specialized. You might have a single string comparator that you use
with extractors specialized for different types of records.</p>

<h3>Default Collation</h3>

<p>You will almost certainly define your down extractors and comparators, but the
b&#x2011;tree has a default that works for b&#x2011;tree that stores only
JavaScript primitives.</p></td>

<p>Our b&#x2011;tree has two types of pages. Leaf pages and branch pages.</p>

<p>A <strong><em>leaf page</em></strong> contains records. A <strong><em>branch page</em></strong> contains references to
other pages.</p>

<p>Both leaf pages and branch pages are ordered according to the collation.</p>

<p>To find a record, we descend a tree of branch pages to find the leaf page that
contains the record. That is a b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<h2>Page Storage</h2>

<p>The <code>IO</code> class manages the reading and writing of leaf and branch pages to and
from disk, page locking and page caching. It also implements the binary search
we use to search the pages.</p></td>

in a single directory. The directory is specified by the application
developer when the <code>Strata</code> object is constructed.</p>

<p>Page files contain one or more JSON strings, one string per line. The line
based JSON format plays nice with traditional UNIX text utilities.</p>

<p>A <strong><em>leaf page file</em></strong> contains <strong><em>insert objects</em></strong>, <strong><em>delete objects</em></strong>
and <strong><em>position array objects</em></strong>, stored as JSON, one object per line, as
described above. The JSON objects stored on behalf of the client are called
<strong><em>records</em></strong> and they are contained within the insert objects.</p>

<p>A <strong><em>branch page file</em></strong> contains a single JSON object stored on a single
line that contains the array of child page addresses.</p>

<p>When we read records and record keys off the disk, we store them in an
object that acts as a cache for the page. The in memory page object contains
an array of integers that act as either page addresses or record positions.
We call this the <strong><em>reference array</em></strong>. The integers are stored in the
reference array in the collation order of the stored records they reference.</p>

<p>The in memory page object also contains a map of integer addresses to JSON
objects. This is the <strong><em>record cache</em></strong> for the page object. The integers in
the reference array are always present when the page is loaded, so that the
integer array is dense, but the record cache only contains entries for
records that have been referenced. We use a binary search to probe for keys
and records, so we can avoid loading records we don't need.</p>

method and move the replacement into place with the <code>replace</code> method. This
two step write is part of our crash recovery strategy.</p>

          <td class="docs"><h3>Page Caching</h3>

<p>We keep an in&#x2011;memory map of page addresses to page objects. This is
our <strong><em>page cache</em></strong>.</p>

<h4>Most-Recently Used List</h4>

<p>We also maintain a <strong><em>most-recently used list</em></strong> as a linked list using the
page objects as list nodes. When we reference a page, we unlink it from the
linked list and relink it at the head of the ist. When we want to cull the
cache, we can remove the pages at the end of the linked list, since they are
the least recently used.</p>

<h4>Cache Purge Trigger</h4>

<p>There are a few ways we could schedule a cache purge; elapsed time, after a
certain number of requests, when a reference count reaches zero, or when
when a limit is reached.</p>

<p>We take the limits approach. The bulk of a cached page is the size of the
references array and the size of objects in records map. We keep track of
those sizes. When we reach an application developer specified maxmimum size
for cached records and page references for the entire b&#x2011;tree, we
trigger a cache purge to bring it below the maxiumum size. The purge will
remove entries from the end of the most-recently used list until the limit
is met.</p>

<h4>JSON Size</h4>

<p>Cache size would be difficult to guage if our b&#x2011;tree were an
in&#x2011;memory data structure, but we can get a good enough relative
measure of the size of a page using the length of the JSON strings used to
store records and references. </p>

<p>The <strong><em>JSON size</em></strong> of a branch page is the string length of the address
array when serialized to JSON, plus the string length of each key loaded
into memory when serialized to JSON. The JSON size of leaf page is the
string length of the file position array when serialized to JSON, plus the
string length of each record loaded in memory when serialized to JSON.</p>

<p>This is not an exact measure of the system memory committed to the in memory
representation of the b&#x2011;tree. It is a fuzzy measure of the relative
heft of page in memory. An exact mesure is not necessary. We only need to be
sure to trigger a cache purge at some point before we reach the hard limits
imposed by sytem memory or the V8 JavaScript engine.</p>

<h4>Cache Entries</h4>

<p>Cache entries are the page objects themselves.</p>

<p>It is important that the page objects are unique, that we do not represent a
page file with more than one page object, because the page objects house the
locking mechanisms. The page object acts as a mutex for page data.</p>

<p>The cache entires are linked to form a doubly-linked list. The doubly-linked
list of cache entries has a head node that has a null address, so that end
of list traversal is unambiguous.</p>

<p>We always move a page to the front of the core list when we reference it
during b&#x2011;tree descent.</p>

<h4>Pages Held for Housekeeping</h4>

<p>There may be page objects loaded for housekeeping only. When balancing the
tree, the page length of a page is needed to determine if the page needs to
be split, or if it can merged with a sibling page.</p>

<p>We only need the length of the page to create our balance plan, however, not
the cached references and records. The page object keeps a copy of the
length in a <code>length</code> property. We can delete the page's reference array, as
well as the page's object cache. The page object the page entry itself
cannot be remove from the cache until it is no longer needed to calculate a
split or merge.</p>

<p>We use reference counting to determine if an entry is participating in
balance calcuations. If the page is being referenced by a balancer, we purge
the reference array cached records and keys, but we do not unlink the page
object from the most-recenlty used list nor remove it from the cache.</p></td>

<p>Five key things to know about leaf pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>A leaf page is an array of records.</li>
<li>The key of the first record is the key for the page.</li>
<li>If the first record is deleted, we keep a it as a ghost record, for the
sake of the key, until the leaf page can be vacuumed.</li>
<li>The leaf page file is a text file of JSON strings that is an append log of
record insertions and deletions.</li>
<li>A leaf page cannot contain two records that share the same key, therefore
the b&#x2011;tree cannot contain duplicates.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Constant Time</h4>

<p>In the abstract, a leaf page is an array of records.  Given an integer, the
leaf page will return the record stored at the offset of the array. This
lookup is performed in constant time when the record is in memory.</p>

<p>This lookup is performed in more or less constant time when the record is
uncached, if you're willing to say that random access into a file is
constant time for practical purposes, otherwise it is <em>O(log n)</em>, where <em>n</em>
is the number of file system blocks used to store the leaf page file.</p>

<h4>Binary Search</h4>

<p>Our leaf page implemenation maintains an array of file positions called a
positions array. A file position in the positions array references a record
in the leaf page file by its file position. The positions in the positions
array are sorted according to the b&#x2011;tree collation of the referenced
records.</p>

<p>In the leaf page file, a record is stored as JSON string. Not all of the
records are loaded when the page loads. Records that are not loaded when the
page is loaded, are loaded as needed. The leaf page keeps a map (a
JavaScript <code>Object</code>) that maps file positions to deserialized records.</p>

<p>Because the records are sorted, and because a lookup takes constant time, we
can search for a record in a leaf page using binary search in logorithmic
time.</p>

<h4>No Duplicates</h4>

<p>Leaf pages cannot contain duplicate records. Therefore, the b&#x2011;tree
cannot contain duplicate records.</p>

<p>You can simulate duplicate records by adding a series value to your key and
which is stored in your record. The cursor implementation is designed
facilitate <strong><em>pseudo-duplicate</em></strong> keys in this fashion.</p>

<p>In theory, leaf pages can contain <code>null</code>, and <code>null</code> can be used as a key.
However, if you want to allow <code>null</code> keys in your b&#x2011;tree, you almost
certainly want to allow more than one <code>null</code> key, so you'll end up using the
pseudo-duplicate strategy for <code>null</code> keys as well.</p>

<h4>Leaf Page Key</h4>

<p>The first record of every leaf page is the key value of the leaf page.</p>

<p>When we delete records from the leaf page, if we delete the first reord, we
keep a ghost of the record around, so we will know the key value of the leaf
page.</p>

<h4>Leaf Page Split</h4>

<p>If the record count of leaf page, the page length, exceeds the leaf page
order, the leaf page is split.</p></td>

records to the application developer. We're not strict about ownership, we
don't defensively copy the record before returning it or anything, so the

won't be able to trust the recalcuated JSON size. We keep a copy of the size

<p>TODO address array objects are actually reference objects, or position
objects? Right.</p>

<p>There are three types of objects in a leaf tier file, <strong><em>insert objects</em></strong>,
<strong><em>delete objects</em></strong>, and <strong><em>position array objects</em></strong>.</p>

<p>An insert object contains a <strong><em>record</em></strong> and the index in the position array
where the record's position would be inserted to preserve the sort order of
the position array.</p>

file, the leaf tier is reconstituted by replaying the inserts and deletes
described by the insert and delete objects.</p>

<p>The JSON objects stored in the leaf array are JSON arrays. The first element
is used as a flag to indicate the type of object.</p>

<p>If the first element is an integer greater than zero, it indicates an insert
object.  The integer is the one based index into the zero based position
array, indicating the index where the position of the current insert object
should be inserted. The second element of the leaf tier object array is the
record object.</p>

binary file format, there would be no forgiveness. If we were truly a
human format, then certianly there would be forgiveness, but we're not,
not really a text format for editing, only one for sanity checking. Thus a
line alway ends with <code>"]\n"</code>, so we know that something is wrong. If the
last line does not end this way, it is treated as a bad write and the
record is discarded. Now, we could do that, but the chances that a
developer will dip into the files and make an edit are rather high. Hmm...

<p>Five key things to know about branch pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>A branch page contains an array of addresses of child pages.</li>
<li>The left most address is the left child of the entire branch page.</li>
<li>The branch page keys are looked up as needed  by descending the tree to
the left most leaf page of a child and using the leaf page page key.</li>
<li>The root branch page is always at address <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To find the a record in the b&#x2011;tree, we first use a tree of branch pages to
find the leaf page that contains our record.</p>

<p>A branch page contains the addresses of <strong><em>child pages</em></strong>. This array of
page addresses is essentially an <em>array of children</em>.</p>

<p>The child addresses are ordered according to the b&#x2011;tree collation of the
keys of the directly or indirectly referenced leaf pages.</p>

<p>There are three types of branch pages, penultimate branch pages, interior
branch pages, and the root branch page.</p>

<h4>Penultimate Branch Pages</h4>

<p>A penultimate branch page is a branch page whose children are leaf pages. If
a branch page is not penultimate, then its children are branch pages.</p>

<p>In a penultimate branch page, the array of children is ordered by the
b&#x2011;tree
collation using a first record in the referenced leaf page for ordering.
That is, the first record of the leaf page is used as the key associated
with a page address in a penultimate branch page.</p>

<p>The non-leaf nodes of a b&#x2011;tree have the property that the number of node
children is one greater than the number of keys. We obtain this property by
treating the first child as the left child of the entire page, and excluding
its key from the search. We search the subsequent keys to find the first key
that is grater than or equal to the record sought. Essentially, when we
encouter a key that is greater than our sought record, we know that the
record is contained in the leaf page child associated with the key before
it. We are able to perform this search using binary search in logarithmic
time.</p>

<p>By ignoring the key of the first leaf page, the penultimate branch page has
a number of children that is one greater than the number of keys.</p>

<p>Notice that, when we are inserting a record into a leaf page other than the
left leaf page, we add it to a leaf page whose key is equal to or greater
than the penultimate branch key, so that the first record does not change,
and therefore that penultimate branch key does not change. The exception is
the left leaf page, which accepts all the records less than the first key,
and therefore may accept a record less than its current least record.</p>

<p>An insertion can only insert a into the left most leaf page of a penultimate
branch page a record less than the least record of the leaf page.</p>

<h4>Interior Branch Pages</h4>

<p>A branch page whose children are other branch pages is called an interior
branch page.</p>

<p>Like the penultimate branch page, we treat the first child of an interior
branch page as the left child of the entire page. Like the penultimate
branch page the subsequent children have an associated key that is the first
record of a leaf page.</p>

<p>The key is obtained by decending the sub&#x2011;tree referenced by the child. We
first visit the branch page referneced by the child. We then visit left
children recursively, visiting the left child of the child, and the left
child of any subsquently visited children, until we reach a leaf page.  The
first record of that leaf page is the key to associate with the child
address in the address array of the interior branch page.</p>

<p>It is the nature of the b&#x2011;tree that keys move up to the higher levels of the
tree as pages split, while preserving the collation order of the keys. When
a branch page splits, a key from the middle of the page is chosen as a
partition. The partition is used as the key for the right half of the split
page in the parent page.</p>

<p>Our implementation does not store the keys, as you may have noticed, but
decends down to the leaf page to fetch the record to use as a key. </p>

<p>We start from a penultimate page as a root page. When a leaf page fills, we
split it, creating a new right leaf page. The penultimate page uses the
first record of the new right page as the key to associate with that page.</p>

<p>When the root penultimate page is full we split it, so that the root page is
an interior page with two children, which are two penultimate pages. The
tree now contains a root interior branch page, with a left penultimate
branch page and a right penultimate branch page.</p>

<p>The root interior branch page has one key. Prior to split, that key was
associated with the address of a child leaf page. After split, the key is
associated with the right penultimate branch page. The leaf page is now the
left child of the right penultimate branch page.</p>

<p>When we visit the root interior page, to obtain the key to associate with
the right penultimate page, we visit the right penultimate page, then we
visit its left child, the leaf page whose first record is the key.</p>

<h4>Root Branch Page</h4>

<p>The root page is the first page we consult to find the desired leaf page.
Our b&#x2011;tree always contains a root page. The b&#x2011;tree is never so empty that
the root page disappears. The root page always has the same address.</p>

<p>TK move. Until the root branch page is split, it is both the root branch
page and a penultimate branch page.</p>

<h3>Keys and First Records</h3>

<p>We said that it is only possible for an insertion to insert a into the left
most child leaf page of a penultimate branch page a record less than the
least record. We can say about a tree rooted by an interor branch page, that
an insertion is only able to insert into the left most leaf page in the
<em>entire tree</em> a record less than the least record.</p>

<p>Using our example tree with one root interior page, with two penultimate
branch page children, we cannot insert a record into the right penultimate
branch page that will displace the first record of its left most child
branch, because that first record is the key for the right penultimate
branch page.  When we insert a record that is less than the key, the search
for a leaf page to store the record goes to the left of the key. It cannot
descend into the right penultimate branch page, so it is impossible for it
be inserted into left child of the right penultimate branch page, so the
first record left child of the penultimate branch page will never be
displaced by an insertion.</p>

<p>Only if we insert a record that is less than least key of the left
penultimate page do we face the possibility of displacing the first record
of a leaf page, and that leaf page is the left most leaf page in the entire
tree.</p>

<p>This maintains a property of the b&#x2011;tree that for every leaf page except the
left most leaf page, there exists a unique branch page key derived from the
first record of the page.</p>

<p>As above, you can find the first record used to derive a key by visting the
child and going left. You can find the leaf page to the left of the leaf
page used to derive a page branch key, by visiting the child to the left of
the key and going right.</p>

<p>NOTE Literate programming has finally materialized with Docco and
CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>When the root page splits, it becomes an interior branch page. Until it
splits it is both the root page and a penultimate page.</p></td>

<p>We create a new branch pages in memory. They do not exist on disk until they

<p>A new branch page is given the next unused page number.</p>

<p>In memory, a branch page is an array of child page addresses. It keeps track
of its key and whether or not it is a penultimate branch page. The cache is
used to cache the keys associated with the child page addresses. The cache
maps the address of a child page to a key extracted from the first record of
the leaf page referenced by the child page address.</p>

<p>Our in memory is also cached and added as a node an MRU list. We must make
sure that each page has only one in memory representation, because the in

<p>Opening an existing database is a matter checking for any evidence of a hard
shutdown. You never know. There may be a banged up leaf page file, one who's
last append did not complete. We won't know that until we open it.</p>

<p>Ah, no. Let's revisit. Here's a simple strategy. Open touches a file.
Closing deletes teh file. If we open and the file exists, then we probably
have to inspect every file that was modified after the modification,
adjusting for dst? No because we'll be using seconds since the epoch. Only
if the system time is changed do we have a problem.</p>

<p>Thus, we have a reference point. Any file after needs to be inspected. We
load it, and our <code>readLeaf</code> function will check for bad JSON, finding it
very quickly.</p>

<p>Now, we might have been in the middle of a split. The presenence of <code>*.new</code>
files would indicate that. We can probably delete the split. Hmm..</p>

<p>We can add more to the suffix. <code>*.new.0</code>, or <code>*.commit</code>, which is the last
replacement. If we have a case where there is a file named <code>*.commit</code> that
does not have a corresponding permanent file, then we have a case where the
permenant file has been deleted and not linked, but all the others have
been, since this operaiton will go last, so we complete it to go forward.</p>

<p>Otherwise, we delete the <code>*.commit</code>. We delete all the replacments that are
not commits.</p>

<p>We can always do a thorough rebuild of some kind.</p>

<p>Probably need "r" to not create the crash file, in case we're reading from a
read only file system, or something..</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><h3>Concurrency</h3>

<p>Although there is only a single thread in a Node.js process, the
b&#x2011;tree is still a concurrent data structure.</p>

<p>When we navigate the tree from the root to search for a key in the tree, we
descend the b&x2011;. The act of descending the b&#x2011;tree is called a
<strong><em>descent</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A descent is a unit of work in our concurrency model. Once descent of the
b&#x2011;tree can make progress while another descent of the tree is waiting
on evented I/O.  Instead of thinking about concurrency in terms of threads
we talk about concurrent descents of the b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<p>Decents of the b&#x2011;tree can become concurrent when descent encounters a
page that is not in memory. While it is waiting on evented I/O to load the
page files, the main thread of the process can make progress on another
request to search or alter the b&#x2011;tree, it can make process on another
descent.</p>

<p>This concurrency keeps the CPU and I/O loaded.</p>

<p>Note that the b&#x2011;tree must only be read and written by a single
Node.js process. You can't have two Node.js processes serving the same
database directory.</p>

<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>Every page has a read/write lock. Pages are obtained through the <code>IO.lock</code>
method, so that every time we obtain a page, it comes to us locked.</p>

<p>Locking is internal and not exposed to the application developer. However,
the application developer must remember to close cursors, in order to
release the locks that cursors hold.</p>

<h4>Shared and Exclusive</h4>

<p>When we obtain a lock to read the page, we obtain a <strong><em>shared lock</em></strong>. The
shared lock allows other descents to also obtain a lock on the page. With a
shared lock, you can read the page, knowing that it will not change.</p>

<p>When we obtain a lock to write the page, we obtain an <strong><em>exclusive lock</em></strong>.
The exclusive lock prevents all other descents from obtaining any sort of
lock on the page. No other page will be able to obtain neither a shared nor
an exclusive lock.</p>

<h4>Locking Sub-Trees</h4>

<p>When we descend the tree, moving from parent page to child page, we obtain
locks in descending order. This means that if we obtain an exclusive lock on
a page, no other descent will be able to travel from the parent of that
page, to the children of that page. It effectively blocks new descents from
entering the <strong><em>sub&#x2011;tree</em></strong> that is defined by the exclusively
locked page and all its children.</p>

<h4>Rationale for Locking</h4>

<p>Locking prevents race conditions where a descent that is waiting on an
evented I/O request returns to find that the structure of the b&#x2011;tree
has changed drastically. For example, while a descent was waiting for a leaf
page to load into memory, another descent might load the same page into
memory, merge the leaf page with its sibling, and delete it.</p>

<h4>Caching</h4>

<p>Locks prevent cache purges. When a cache purge is triggered, a page will not
be purged from the cache, if there are outstanding locks on the page.</p>

<h4>Lock Properties</h4>

<p>The locking mechanism is a writer preferred shared read, exclusive write
lock. If a descent holds an exclusive write lock, then all lock requests by
other descents are blocked. If one or more descents hold a shared read lock,
then any request for an exclusive write lock is blocked. Any request for a
shared read lock is granted, unless an exclusive write lock is queued. </p>

<p>The locks are not re-entrant.</p></td>

<p>Nor do we use file system locking.</p>

<p>Instead, we simulate locks using callbacks. A call to <code>lock</code> is an evented
function call that provides a callback. If the <code>lock</code> method can grant the
lock request to the caller, the lock method will invoke the callback.</p>

<p>If the <code>lock</code> method cannot grant the lock request, the <code>lock</code> method will
queue the callback into a queue of callbacks associated with the page.
When other descents release the locks that prevent the lock request, the
lock request callback is dequeued, and the callback invoked.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><h2>Descent</h2>

<p>We use the term <em>descent</em> to describe b&#x2011;tree operations, because all
b&#x2011;tree operations require a descent of the b&#x2011;tree, a traversal
of the b&#x2011;tree starting from the root. Whenever we are search the tree,
insert or delete records, or balance the tree with a page splits and merges,
we first begin with a descent of the b&#x2011;tree, from the root, to find the
page we want to act upon.</p>

<h4>Descent as Unit of Work</h4>

<p>We use the term descent to describe the both traversal of the b&#x2011;tree and the
subsequent actions performed when when the desired page is found.</p>

<p>The descent is the unit of work in our concurrency model.  A descent is
analogous to a thread, because when a descent waits on I/O, other descents can
make progress.</p>

<p>Descents can make progress concurrently, even though Node.js only has a single
thread of execution. Descents do not actually make progress in parallel, but
their progress can be interleaved. When we descend the tree, we may have to
wait for evented I/O to read or write a page. While we wait, we can make
progress on another descent in the main thread of execution.</p>

<p>Because descents can make interleaved progress, we need to synchronize access
to b&#x2011;tree pages, just as we would with a multi-threaded b&#x2011;tree implementation.
When we descend the b&#x2011;tree we need to make sure that we do not alter pages
that another waiting descent needs to complete its descent when it awakes, nor
read pages that a waiting descent had begun to alter before it had to wait.</p>

<p>These are race conditions. We use the shared read/exclusive write locks
described in the <code>IO</code> class above to guard against these race conditions.</p>

<h4>Classes of Descent</h4>

<p>When we descend to leaf pages of a search b&#x2011;tree to obtain records, we
<em>search</em> the b&#x2011;tree. When we change the size of the b&#x2011;tree by adding or
deleting records we <em>edit</em> the b&#x2011;tree. When we change the structure of the
b&#x2011;tree by splitting or merging pages, we <em>balance</em> the b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<p>We talk about search descents, edit descents, and balance descents we we
describe the interaction of b&#x2011;tree operations.</p>

<p>We use these terms in this document to save the chore of writing, and the
confustion of reading; insert or delete, or split or merge. We also want to
draw a distinction between changing the count of records stored in the
b&#x2011;tree, <em>editing</em>, and changing the height of the b&#x2011;tree, the
count of pages, or the choice of keys, <em>balancing</em>.</p>

<h4>Locking on Descent</h4>

<p>Becase a search descent does not alter the structure of the b&#x2011;tree, Multiple
search descents can be performed concurrently, without interfering with each
other.</p>

<p>Descents that alter the b&#x2011;tree exclusive access, but only to the pages they
alter. A search descent can still make progres in the presence of an
alteration decent, so long as the search does not visit the pages being
altered.</p>

<p>A search descent obtains shared locks on the pages that it visits.  An
alteration descent obtains exclusive locks on the pages that it needs to
alter. The alteration descent will obtain shared locks on the pages that
visits in search the pages that it wants to alter.</p>

<h4>Locking Hand Over Hand</h4>

<p>To allow progress in parallel, we lock only the pages we need to descend the
tree, for only as long as we takes to determine which page to visit next.
Metaphically, we descend the tree locking hand-over-hand.</p>

<p>We start from the root page. We lock the root page. We perform a binary search
that compares our search key against the keys in the root page. We determine
the correct child page to visit to continue our search. We lock the child
page. We then release the lock on the parent page.</p>

<p>We repeat the process of locking a page, searching it, locking a child, and
then releasing the lock on the child's parent.</p>

<p>We hold the lock on the parent page while we aquire the lock on the child page
because we don't want another descent to alter the parent page, invaliding the
direction of our descent.</p>

<h4>Lateral Traversal</h4>

<p>Both branch pages and leaf pages are singly linked to their right sibling. If
you hold a lock on a page, you are allowed to obtain a lock on its right
sibling. This left right ordering allows us to traverse a level of the
b&#x2011;tree,
which simplifies the implemtation of record cursors and page merges.</p>

<p>When we move from a page to its right sibling, we hold the lock on the left
page until we've obtained the lock on the right sibling. The prevents another
descent from relinking linking our page and invalidating our traversal.</p>

<h4>Deadlock Prevention and Traversal Direction</h4>

<p>To prevent deadlock, we always move form a parent node to a child node, or
form a left sibling to a right sibling.
so that we do not create a condition
where on descent </p>

<p>Othewise we would deadlock when a descent that has an exclusive lock on a
parent attempted to obtain a lock on child, while another descent has either
sort of lock on the child attempted to obtain a lock on the parent. By only
obtaining locks top down, we avoid this deadlock condition because all of the
descents obtain locks in the same order.</p>

<p>When traversing the tree laterally, we always travel from a page to the right
sibling of that page. Two descents traversing a level in both directions would
deadlock when they encountered each other, if one of the descents was locking
exclusively.</p>

<p>To prevent a deadlock when a left right traversal coincides with the top down
traversal, we insist that when a parent obtains a lock on more than one child,
it locks the children in left to right order. That is, we must remember the
left right ordering regardless of whether we're navigating using a page's link
to it's right sibling, or whether we're referencing a branch page's children
pages.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><h2>Cursors</h2>

<p>Application developers navigate the b&#x2011;tree using one of two types of
<strong><em>cursor</em></strong>. To read records in the b&x2011;tree they use an <strong><em>iterator</em></strong>.
To read records, as well as insert and delete records, they use <strong><em>mutator</em></strong>.</p>

<p>An iterator provides random access to the records in a page. It can move from
a page to the right sibling of the page. A mutator does the same, but it is
also able to insert or delete records into the current page.</p>

<h3>Iterator</h3>

<p>The application developer uses an iterator to move across the leaf pages of
the b&#x2011;tree in ascending collation order, one leaf page a time.</p>

<h4>Search Keys</h4>

<p>The application developer obtains an iterator by calling <code>Strata.iterator</code>
with a <strong><em>search key</em></strong>.  The search key is used to find the leaf page where
the record from which the key is derived belongs in the b&#x2011;tree. The
record may not actually exist in the b&#x2011;tree, in which case the iterator
begins with the leaf page where record <em>would</em> be.</p>

<h4>Page by Page</h4>

<p>The leaf pages themselves are visited one at a time, not the records.
The iterator can randomly access any record a the currently visited leaf page.</p>

<p>When a page is visited is read locked, so that other descents can visit the
page, but they cannot insert or delete records. By locking the pages left to
right hand over hand, then there is no way for the tree to mutate such that
would defeat our iteration. Leaf pages that we've visited may by edited by
another descent after we've visited them, however.</p>

<p>TK Definition of keys and records. Go back up and make sure one is there.</p>

<h4>Record Ranges</h4>

<p>The cursor will define an <code>offset</code> property and a <code>length</code> property. The
<code>offset</code> is positioned at the first record in the page whose key is equal to
or greater than the search key. The <code>length</code> is count of records in the page.
This defines the range of records whose key is greater than or equal to the
search key.</p>

<p>On the first page visited, the key of the record at the <code>index</code> is greater
than or equal to the search key. Every key of every record that follows the
record at the index is greater than the search key.</p>

<h4>Full Tree Iteration</h4>

<p>The application developer can also obtain an iterator that begins at the left
most leaf page by calling <code>Strata.iterator</code> without a search key. This
positions the iterator a the first leaf page in the b&#x2011;tree and the
index at the first record in b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<h4>Double Loop</h4>

<p>The interface to iteration requires the application developer to implement
double loop to traverse the leaf pages. The outer loop moves from page to
page. The inner loop moves from record to record. The iterator interface does
not hide the underlying structure of the leaf pages.</p>

<p>It is not indended to be an abstraction. It is intended to expose the
structure. Do not confuse the iterator with an iterator from other APIs that
exposes one item at a time. Our iterator exposes a range of records.</p>

<h4>Ranged Searches</h4>

<p>Ranged searches are performed by searching for the start of the range and
iterating to the end of the range. There is nothing to this. It is how
iterator is implemented.</p>

<p>We may be interested in searching for time series data that occured between
noon and midnight, where are timestamp is POSIX time, milliseconds since the
epoch.  We create an iterator with a search key that is noon according to
POSIX time. It doesn't matter to us if there were no events that occured
exactly at the millisecond that defines noon. Our iterator begins at the point
that is either an event that occured millisecond that defines noon, or else
the first event that occured after the noon millisecond.</p>

<p>When we encounter to the first event that occurs after midnight, we ignore
that event and terminate traversal. We've successfully found all the events in
our range.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><p>A mutator is an iterator that can also edit leaf pages. It can delete records
from the currently visit leaf page. It can insert records into the current
leaf page, if the record belongs in the current leaf page.</p>

<p>As with <code>Iterator</code>, it moves across the leaf pages of an the b&#x2011;tree in
ascending collation order. It has random access to the records in the page
using an index into the array of records.</p>

<p>As with <code>Iterator</code>, the application developer obtains an iterator by calling
<code>Strata.mutator</code> with a search key.</p>

<h4>Ranged Inserts</h4>

<p>You can insert a range of records using a single mutator. This is efficient if
you have a range of records whose keys are close together, maybe so close that
they are all on the same page, so you can descend the tree to the correct page
and insert them in one fell swoop.</p>

<h4>Ambiguous Insert Locations</h4>

<p>Insert locations for ranged inserts can be ambiguous if the binary search
indicates that a record should be inserted at the end of the leaf page, after
the current last record in the leaf page. If the insert location is after the
last record, it could be the case that the record really belongs to a right
sibling leaf page.</p>

<p>This is only a problem when we insert a record whose key is not the key used
to create the mutator. An insert location is always unambiguous if the key is
the search key used to locate the first page. The key is determined to belong
inside the leaf page by virtue of a desent of the b&#x2011;tree. That is
unambiguous.</p>

<p>To know if a subsequent record insert really does belong after the last record
but before the first record of the right sibling leaf page, we have to load
the right sibling leaf page and peek at the record. When we do this, we need
to keep the right sibling leaf page locked, so that the key of the right
sibling page cannot change.</p>

<p>This peek has a cost. If you are inserting a range, and the records are more
often pages apart from each other than they are on the same page, it might not
be worth it to peek. It might be more efficient to assume that a the next
record is much futher along and create a new mutator for the remainder of the
insert range. In this case we're saying, see if you can insert the next record
on this page as long as we're here, but we leaf traversal is innefficent for
our range,  so don't try too hard.</p>

<p>If she is only inserting a single record, there's no ambiguity, because she'll
use the key of the record to create the mutator. There is no need to enable
peek for a single insert, but there is no real cost either.</p>

<h4>Duplicate Keys</h4>

<p>Although duplicate keys are not allowed, abstracted duplicate keys are not
difficult for the application developer to implement given a mutator. The
application developer can move forward through a series and append a record
that has one greater than the maximum record.  Not a problem to worry about
ambiguity in this case. Ah, we need to peek though, because we need to get

<p>TK Fix.</p>

<p>In fact, given a key plus a maximum series value, you will always land after
the last one the series, or else a record that is less than the key, which
means that the series is zero. Deleted keys present a problem, so we need to
expose a leaf page key to the user, which, in case of a delete, is definately
the greatest in the series.</p>

<p>There is a cost involved with peeking at the right sibling leaf page to
determine if a record greater than the greatest record in the current leaf

own hands. They can determine the insert location using <code>indexOf</code>, and if it
is after the last record, they can use a new mutator to find the insert
location of the next page.</p>

<p>There is no cost involved when inserting a range into the last leaf page, a
common operation, because the right sibling leaf page does not exist, so
there is no doubt that the records belong on the last page.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><h4>Insertion and Deletion Verus Balance</h4>

<p>We do not attempt to balance the tree with every insertion or deletion. The
client may obtain a cursor to the leaf pages, iterate through them deleting
records along the way. Balacing </p>

<h4>Staccato Blanace Operations</h4>

<p>The b&#x2011;tree balance operations cascade by nature. If you insert a value into a
leaf node, such that the leaf node is beyond capacity, you split the leaf
node, adding a new child to the parent node. If the parent node is now beyond
capacity, you split the parent node, adding a new child to its parent node.
When every node on the path to the leaf node is at capacity, a split of the
leaf node will split every node all they way up to the root.</p>

<p>Merges too move from leaves to root, so that a merge at one level of the
b&#x2011;tree potentially triggers a merge of the parent with one of its siblings.</p>

<p>However, we've established rules for lock acquisition that require that locks
are obtained from the top down, and never from the bottom up. This is why we
do not perform balance operations as a part of a single pass. We instead
descend the tree once to insert or delete records form the leaf pages. We then
descend the tree once for each split or merge of a page.</p>

<p>Much b&#x2011;tree literature makes mention of a potential efficency where you split
full pages on the way back up from an insert. You can determine which pages
would split if the leaf split as you descend the b&#x2011;tree, since you'll visit
every page that would participate in a split.</p>

<p>That efficency applies only for split, and not for merge, because you have to
inspect the left and right siblings of a page to determine if it is time to
merge. If the left sibling page of a page, is not also child of that page's
parent page, then the left sibling page is in a different sub&#x2011;tree. It can not
be reached by the path that was used to find the leaf page where the delete
occured.</p>

<p>The single pass insert on the way down and split on the way up violates the
rules we laid out to prevent deadlock. To abide by our rules, we'd have to
lock exclusively on the way down, then hold the locks on the pages above the
leaf page that were full and could possibly split. This would reduce the
liveliness of our implementation.</p>

<p>There are compromises, but rather than create a complicated locking apparatus,
with upgrades, we're going to simplify our algorithm greatly, by descending
the tree once for each split or merge. </p>

<p>When we travel to the unbalanced page, we acquire shared locks in the hand
over hand fashion used for search. We acquire exclusive locks only on those
pages that participate in the balance operation. That is two pages in the case
of the split. In the case of a merge that is three pages. During a balance
operation are locking exclusively, at most, three pages at a time.</p>

<p>If out balance operation casades so that it requires a balance at every level,
we'll descend the tree once for every level. However, the path we follow is
almost certain to be in memory, since we're revisting the same path.</p>

<p>Also, a balance operation will involve an increasing number of levels with
decreasing frequency. A split will most often require that only the leaf page
is split. The penultimate pages will be involved in a balance operation at
least an order of mangitude less frequently. The pages above the penultimate
branch pages will be involved in a balance operation yet another order of
mangniutde less frequently.</p>

<p>Conserving descents during balance operations is a false economy. It
complicates lock acquisition. It reduces the liveliness of the b&#x2011;tree.</p>

<p>The multiple descents will allow searches of the b&#x2011;tree to make progress
between balance operations.</p>

<h5>Descent as Unit of Work</h5>

<p>We can see that a descent of the tree is analogous to a thread in
multi-threaded operation. A decent is an actor on the tree, performing a
single balance operation, searching </p>

<h5>Delayed Balance</h5>

<p>We've determined that we do not want to perform a split or merge of the leaf
level the moment we've detected the need for one. If we fill a leaf page, we
descend the tree again to split the leaf page.</p>

<p>Because the b&#x2011;tree is a concurrent structure, the leaf split descent may
discover that another descent has removed a record, and a leaf split is no
longer necessary. There may be, in fact, a descent on the way to the left
sibling of the page, to check for the potential for a merge.</p>

<p>The concurrent operation means that we have to deal with situation where we've
undertaken a descent to balance the b&#x2011;tree, but another series of descents
has rendered that plan invalid.</p>

<p>As long as we're dealing with that problem, we may as well decouple insertion
and deletion form split and merge entirely, and see if we can't gain more
liveliness, and a simpiler implementation, by separating these concerns.</p>

<p>We can provide an interface where the application developer can insert or
delete any number of records, then order a balance of the tree that takes all
the changes into account. This can avoid degenerate cases of sort where a leaf
page at the split threshold and the application in turn inserts and deletes a
single record from it.</p>

<p>We can provide the application developer with a cursor. The cursor can delete
a range of values, or insert a range of values, without having to descend the
tree for each inserted value. The developer can insert or delete records as
fast as the operating system can append a string to a file. We'll balance this
mess for her later.</p>

<p>It is still cheap to check for balance for single inserts or deletes, as if we
were checking as part of a single pass.</p>

<h5>Balance Thread</h5>

<p>We perform balance operations one a time. We do not begin a new balance
operation until the previous one completes. In essence, we perform balancing
in a separate thread of execution.</p>

<p>Of course, a Node.js application really only has one thread of execution. In
our b&#x2011;tree, however, multiple descents can make progress at the time, or
rather, the progress made by one decent, while another descent waits on I/O.</p>

<p>We ensure that only one descent at a time is making progress toward the
balance of the tree. This simpilies or balance implementation, because the
structure of the tree, its depth and number of pages, will only be changed one
one series of descents. A balance descent can assume that the tree retain its
structure while the balance descent waits on I/O.</p>

<h5>Balancer</h5>

<p>We will call the code that co-ordinates the series of splits and merges to
balance the tree, the <em>balancer</em>.</p>

<p>The balancer maintains an offset count for each modified leaf page in the
b&#x2011;tree. When an insert is performed, the offset count for the leaf page is
incremented.  When a delete is performed, the offset count for the leaf page
is decremented. This keeps track of the total change in size.</p>

<p>We use the offset counts to determine which pages changed.</p>

<h5>Balance Cutoff</h5>

<p>When it comes time to balance, we create a new balancer and put it in place to
collect a new round of offset counts, while we are off balancing the pages
gathered in the last round balance counts.</p>

<p>We create a balance plan for the current set of pages. We balance the tree,
splitting and merging pages according to our balance plan. Only one balancer
balances the tree at a time. The balancer perform one split or merge descent
at a time. Balance descents are never concurrent with other balance descents.</p>

<p>While balancing takes place, records can be inserted and deleted concurrently.
Those changes will be reflected when the next balancer balances the tree.</p>

<h5>Creating a Balance Plan</h5>

<p>When it comes time to balance, we consult the pages for which we've maintained
the offset counts. If the page is greater than the maximum page size, we split
the page. That much is obvious. Otherwise, if the offset count is negative,
we've deleted records. There may be an opportunity to merge, so we check the
left and right siblings of the page to determine if a merge is possible.</p>

<p>Determining a plan for a merge requires inspecting three pages, the page that
decreased in size, plus its left and right sibling pages. We merge a page with
the sibling that will create the smallest page that is less than or equal to
the maximum page size.</p>

<h5>Purging the Cache</h5>

<p>When inspecting page for merge, we are only interested in the count of records
in the page. It may have been a long time since the last merge, so we might
have accumulated a lot of pages that need to be consulted. To create a
complete plan, we'll need to gather up the sizes of all the leaf pages, and
the only way to get the size of a page is to load it into memory. But, we
won't need to keep the page in memory, because we only need the size.</p>

<p>When we calculate a merge, we load the left and right sibling. We're touching
a lot of pages that we don't really know that we need.</p>

<p>When we lock a page, we indicate that if the page is loaded, it ought to be
loaded into balancer most-recently used list. This indicates that the page was
loaded by the balancer. We also set the balancer flag, indiciating that we
need to preserve the page for record count, even if the actual page data is
discarded by a cache purge.</p>

<p>We check the cache size frequently. If we're going over, we offer up the
balancer pages to the cache purge first. If we determine that a page will be
used in a balance operation we add it to the core most-recently used list,
where it is subject to the same priority as any other page loaded by the
cache.</p>

<p>Splitting is the simpiler of the two balancing operations.</p>

<p>To split a leaf page, we start by obtaining the key value of the first record.
We can do this by acquiring a read lock on the page, without performing a
descent. The balancer gets to break some rules since it knows that we know
that the b&#x2011;tree is not being otherwise balanced.</p>

<p>We descend the tree until we encoutner the penultimate branch page that is the
parent of the branch page.  We acquire an excsluive lock the branch page. We
can release our shared lock and acquire an exclusive lock. We do not have
retest conditions after the upgrade, because only the balancer would change
the keys in a branch page, and we're the balancer.</p>

<p>We allocate a new leaf page. We append the greater half of the record to the
page. We add the page as a child to the penultimate branch page to the right
of the page we've split. We unlock the pages.</p>

<p>We can see immediately if the penultimate page needs to be split. If it does,
we descend the tree with the same key, stopping at the parent of the
penultimate page. We will have kept the address of the parent of the
penultimate page for this reason. We split the penultimate page, copying the
addresses to a new right sibling. Adding the right sibling to the parent. We
make sure to clear the cache of keys for the addresses we are removing. (Oh,
and clear the cache for the records when you leaf split. Oh, hey, copy the
records as well, duh.)</p>

<p>Note that a page split means a change in size downward. It means that one or
both of our two halves may be a candidate to merge with what were the left and
right siblings of the page before it split. There may have been less than half
a page of records one or both both of the sides of the tree. After we split,
we check for a chance to merge. More live lock fears, but one heck of a
balanced tree.</p>

<h3>Need to Add</h3>

<p>We always balance cascading up. Unlike leaf pages, which we can allow to
depleate, the branch pages cannot be allowed to become empty as we merge leaf
pages. As we delete records, we still keep a ghost of a key. As we delete leaf
pages, we delete the ghost keys. Branch pages become paths to nowhere. They
don't hold their own keys, so they can't find them.  We'd have to have null
keys in our tree. Even if we kept keys around, we're sending searches down a
path to nowhere. There is no leaf page to visit. We get rid of these paths. We
always balance the upper levels immediately, we perform the cascade. Our tree
descent logic would have to account for these empty sub&#x2011;trees. Much better to
balance and keep things orderly.</p>

<p>This raises a concerns about live lock, that we might be balancing </p>

<p>TK Yes file times are enough. Even if the system clock changes drastically,
the file times are all relative to one another. It it changes during
operation, that is a problem, but we're not going to endeavor to provide a
solution that deals with erratic clock times. Worst case, how do we not detect
a file in need of recovery? We ignore files older than the timestamp file. So,
we might have the system clock move far backward, so that the timestamp file
is much newer than all the files that are being updated. Oh, well. What's the
big deal then? How do we fix that? If it is a server install, we demand that
you maintain your clock. If it is a desktop install, we can comb the entire
database, because how big is it going to be?</p>

<p>Hmm... What are you going to do? This is why people like servers.</p>

<h3>Merging</h3>

<p>TODO Great example floating around. Imagine that you've implemented MVCC.
You're always appending, until it is time to vacuum. When you vacuum, you're
deleting all over the place. You may as well do a table scan. You might choose
to iterate through the leaf pages.  You may have kept track of where records
have been stored since the last vacuum, so if you have a terabyte large table,
you're only vacuum the pages that need it.</p>

<p>Merge is from right to left. When we merge we always merge a page into its
left sibling. If we've determined that a page from which records have been
deleted is supposed to merge with its right sibling, we apply our merge
algorithm to the right sibling, so that is is merged with its left sibling. </p>

<p>When we compare a page from which records have been deleted against its
siblings, if the left sibling is to be merged, we use the page itself, the
middle page in our comparison. If the middle page is to merge with the right
page, we use the right page.</p>

<p>To merge a leaf page, we start by obtaining the key value of the first record.
We can do this by acquiring a read lock on the page, without performing a
descent. The balancer gets to break some rules since it knows that we know
that the b&#x2011;tree is not being otherwise balanced.</p>

<p>With that key, we descend the b&#x2011;tree. We know that the key value cannot
change, because it is the balancer that alters keys. The first record may be
deleted by editing, but a ghost of the first record is preserved for the key
value, which is the key value of the page.</p>

<p>When we encouter the key value in a branch page, we acquire an excsluive lock
the branch page. We can release our shared lock and acquire an exclusive lock.
We do not have retest conditions after the upgrade, because only the balancer
would change the keys in a branch page, and we're the balancer.</p>

<p>We then descend the child to the left of the key, instead of to the right as
we would ordinarly. We descend to the left child acquiring, an exclusive lock,
but retaining our exclusive lock on branch page where we found our key. We
then descend to the right most child of every child page, acqcuiring exclusive
locks in the hand-over-hand fashion, until we reach a leaf page. We are now at
the left sibling of the page we want to merge.</p>

<p>We've locked the branch page that contains the key exclusively so that we can
reassign the key. It will no longer be valid when the page is merged into its
left sibling because the first record is now somewhere in the midst of the
left sibling. We lock excluslively hand-over-hand thereafter to squeeze out
any shared locks. Our exclusive lock on the parent containing the key prevents
another descent from entering the sub&#x2011;tree where we are performing the merge.</p>

<p>We now proceed down the path to the merge page as we would ordinarily, except
that we acquire exclusive locks hand-over-hand instead of shared locks. This
will squeeze out any other descents.</p>

<p>We retain the exclusive lock on the penultimate branch page. No other descent
will be able to visit this penultimate branch, because we've blocked entry
into the sub&#x2011;tree and squeeed out the other descents. We still need to hold
onto the exclusive lock, however, otherwise the page might be discarded during
a cache purge, which can happen concurently.</p>

<p>We append the records in the merge page to its left sibling. We remove the
address of the merged page from the penultimate page.</p>

<p>If we've deleted the first child of the penultimate branch page, then we
delete the cached key of the new first child. The new first child is the
left-most child of the penultimate page. Its key, if it not the left-most page
of the entire tree, has been elevated to the exclusively locked branch page
where we ecountered the merge page key. We don't want keys to gather where
they are not used. That is a memory leak.</p>

<p>We clear the merge key from the branch page where we found it. The next
descent that needs it will look up the new merge key. If we found the merge
key in a penultimate page, we need to make sure to clear the key using the
page address we stashed, because the page is now deleted.</p>

<h4>Merging Parent Branches</h4>

<p>Once we've merged a leaf page, we check to see if the penultimate branch page
that lost a child can be merged with one of its siblings. The procedure for
merging branch pages other than the root branch page is the same regardless of
the depth of the branch page.</p>

<p>We acquire the key for the left most page in the sub&#x2011;tree underneath the
branch page. We do this by following the left most children until we reach a
leaf page. We use that key to descend the tree.</p>

<p>we lock the page exclusively. We retain that lock
for the duration of the merge.</p>

<p>When we encounter the key, we descent the child to the left of the key, then
we decent the right most child of every page until we reach the page at the
same depth as the merge page. That is the left sibling of the merge page.</p>

<p>We can then obtain a size for the left sibling, the merge and the right
sibling of the merge. If we are able to merge, we choose a merge page to merge
that page into the left sibling.</p>

<p>We now descend the tree with the key for the merge page. We lock that page
exclusively. We go left then right to the level of the left sibling. We go
right then left to reach the merge page. (We're using page addresses to know
that we've reached the merge page, the key is going to only be useful to find
path on takes to find the left sibling.) We can then copy append addresses to
the left sibling. Remove the merge sibling from its parent. Delete the key
from where we found it, so it can be looked up again.</p>

<p>Before we lose track of the sub&#x2011;tree we're in, we descend to the poteinally
new left most leaf of the parent, and obtain its key to repeat the process.</p>

<h4>Filling the Root Page</h4>

<p>If the parent is the root page, we only do something special when the root
page reaches one child and no keys. At that point, the one child becomes the
root. We will have deleted the last key, merged everything to the left.</p>

<p>We descend again, locking the root. We lock the one child of the root. We copy
the contents of the one root child into the root and delete the child.</p>

<p>This will decrease the height of the b&#x2011;tree by one.</p>

<h4>Deleting Pages</h4>

<p>A page deletion is simply a merge where we prefer to use the empty page as the
merge page. We have to make an exception when the empty page is the left most
page in the entire tree, which is not uncommon for time series data where the
oldest records are regularly purged.</p>

<h4>Purging Deleted First Keys</h4>

<p>Now we merge the parents. We find a penultimate page by the key of the left
most leaf. Similar go left, then get the up to three pages. See if they will
fit. Keep them around in cache. You may visit them again soon.</p>

<p>If they fit, then you merge them. Lock exclusively the form page where you
found the key. Move left into the right. Rewriting. Remove the key from the
parent. You will have it locked. Delete the key.</p>

<p>Then, get the left most leaf key. Okay there is only one thread balancing, so
we will have a consistant depth. This is merge.</p>

<p>Delete the key to trigger the lookup.</p>

<h4>Deleted First Keys</h4>

<p>We fix deleted first keys at balance. Descend locking the key when we see it.
Mark it deleted forever. Then delete the key. It will get looked up again.</p>

<p>We split recursively. Split and put into the parent. If the parent is ready to
split, descend the tree locking the parent of the parent exclusively. We'll
track where that is. No one else is changing the height of the tree. Only one
thread is changing the height of the tree.</p>

<p>We will create a plan to merge and split. We execute our plan. If we reach a
place where our plan is invalid, we requeue, but only if it is invalid. If it
is not invalid, only different, we continue with our merge, or our split.</p>

<p>This give us a potential for live lock. We're constantly creating plans to
merge, that are invalidated, so we create plans and those are invalidated.</p>

<p>Our descent of the tree to balance will be evented anyway. We can probably
make our calculation evented. We were fretting that we'd exacerbate the live
lock problem. Live lock is a problem if it is a problem. There is no real
gauntlet to run. The user can determine if balance will live lock. If there
are a great many operations, then balance, wait a while, then balance, wait a
while. It is up the the end user.</p>

<p>The end user can use the b&#x2011;tree a map, tucking in values, getting them out.
Or else, as an index, to scan, perform table scans. We'll figure that out.</p>

<p>Now I have an API problem. The client will have to know about pages to work
with them. We can iterate through them, in a table scan. We can implement a
merge. We probably need an intelligent cursor, or a reporting cursor.</p></td>

          <td class="docs"><p>There has been a desire second guess the most-recently used list. There is a
desire to link nodes to the back of the list or suspend purges.</p>

<p>There is a desire to cache the addresses of the left sibling pages when
possible, so I wouldn't have to descend the tree. Except that the
most-recently used list works hand in hand with b&#x2011;tree descent. The higher
levels of the tree are kept in memory, because they are more frequently visted
than lower levels. To much iteration along one level threatens to purge other
levels.</p>

<p>One can imagine that when balancing b&#x2011;tree that has been left unbalanced for a
long time, reading in many unbalanced leaf pages will cause the first ones to
flush, which is a pity, since we'll probably need one of them.</p>

<p>Perhaps we suspect a page needs to be split but it doesn't. If the balancer
was the one to load the page, simply to determine that nothing needs to be
done, their is a desire to expedite the removal of the page from the cache.</p>

<p>There are so many desires. It makes one giddy with thoughts of premature
optimization.</p>

<p>We're going to descent the tree to find our left sibling to exercise the
most-recently used cache. We are not going to second guess it. We're going to
defer to the algorithms. The simpiler the code, the more trust you can have in
the code, the more likely your code will be adopted. A wide user base can
inform decisions on optimization. There is always a core of what your
application needs to do, and Strata needs to search and edit records.</p>
