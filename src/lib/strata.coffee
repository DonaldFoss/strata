  # Determines whether to merge two inner tiers into one tier or else to delete
  # an inner tier that has only one child tier but is either the only child tier
  # or its siblings are already full.
  #
  # **Only Children**
  #
  # It is possible that an inner tier may have only one child leaf or inner
  # tier. This occurs in the case where the siblings of of inner tier are at
  # capacity. A merge occurs when two children are combined. The nodes from the
  # child to the right are combined with the nodes from the child to the left.
  # The parent branch that referenced the right child is deleted.
  # 
  # If it is the case that a tier is next to full siblings, as leaves are
  # deleted from that tier, it will not be a candidate to merge with a sibling
  # until it reaches a size of one. At that point, it could merge with a sibling
  # if a deletion were to cause its size to reach zero.
  #
  # However, the single child of that tier has no siblings with which it can
  # merge. A tier with a single child cannot reach a size of zero by merging.
  #
  # If were where to drain the subtree of an inner tier with a single child of
  # every leaf, we would merge its leaf tiers and merge its inner tiers until we
  # had subtree that consisted solely of inner tiers with one child and a leaf
  # with one item. At that point, when we delete the last item, we need to
  # delete the chain of tiers with only children.
  #
  # We deleting any child that is size of one that cannot merge with a sibling.
  # Deletion means freeing the child and removing the branch that references it.
  #
  # The only leaf child will not have a sibling with which it can merge,
  # however. We won't be able to copy leaf items from a right leaf to a left
  # leaf. This means we won't be able to update the linked list of leaves,
  # unless we go to the left of the only child. But, going to the left of the
  # only child requires knowing that we must go to the left.
  #
  # We are not going to know which left to take the first time down, though. The
  # actual pivot is not based on the number of children. It might be above the
  # point where the list of only children begins. As always, it is a pivot whose
  # value matches the first item in the leaf, in this case the only item in the
  # leaf.
  # 
  # Here's how it works.
  #
  # On the way down, we look for a branch that has an inner tier that is size of
  # one. If so, we set a flag in the mutator to note that we are now deleting.
  #
  # If we encounter an inner tier has more than one child on the way down we are
  # not longer in the deleting state.
  #
  # When we reach the leaf, if it has a size of one and we are in the deleting
  # state, then we look in the mutator for a left leaf variable and an is left
  # most flag. More on those later as neither are set.
  #
  # We tell the mutator that we have a last item and that the action has failed,
  # by setting the fail action. Failure means we try again.
  #
  # On the retry, as we descend the tree, we have the last item variable set in
  # the mutator.
  #
  # Note that we are descending the tree again. Because we are a concurrent data
  # structure, the structure of the tree may change. I'll get to that. For now,
  # let's assume that it has not changed.
  #
  # If it has not changed, then we are going to encounter a pivot that has our
  # last item. When we encounter this pivot, we are going to go left. Going left
  # means that we descend to the child of the branch before the branch of the
  # pivot. We then follow each rightmost branch of each inner tier until we reach
  # the right most leaf. That leaf is the leaf before the leaf that is about to
  # be removed. We store this in the mutator.
  #
  # Of course, the leaf to be removed may be the left most leaf in the entire
  # data structure. In that case, we set a variable named left most in the
  # mutator.
  #
  # When we go left, we lock every inner tier and the leaf tier exclusive, to
  # prevent it from being changed by another query in another thread. We always
  # lock from left to right.
  #
  # Now we continue our descent. Eventually, we reach out chain of inner tiers
  # with only one child. That chain may only be one level deep, but there will be
  # such a chain.
  #
  # Now we can add a remove leaf operation to the list of operations in the
  # parent level. This operation will link the next leaf of the left leaf to the
  # next leaf of the remove leaf, reserving our linked list of leaves. It will
  # take place after the normal remove operation, so that if the remove operation
  # fails (because the item to remove does not actually exist) then the leave
  # removal does not occur.
  #
  # I revisited this logic after a year and it took me a while to convince myself
  # that it was not a misunderstanding on my earlier self's part, that these
  # linked lists of otherwise empty tiers are a natural occurrence.
  #
  # The could be addressed by linking the inner tiers and thinking harder, but
  # that would increase the size of the project.
